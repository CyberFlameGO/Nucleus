# Minor Updates

## Added a placeholder token to display the cooldown for a given kit

You can now add the token `{{kitcooldown|<kitname>}}` wherever Nucleus placeholders are parsed to display the cooldown for a given kit.

# Bug Fixes

* Fixed a startup issue preventing Nucleus from running in single player (thanks to Dockter)
* Colour code permissions are now case insensitive
* `/me` now displays correctly
