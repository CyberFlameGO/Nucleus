# Kit Commands are now disabled by default

A very common question that comes up in the Nucleus support channels is "why can my players redeem kits without a cooldown?" This is invariably because server owners incorrectly assume that `nucleus.kit` is permission they need for accessing `/kit`. **It is not**. The permission is `nucleus.kit.base`.

The reason that `nucleus.kit` works is because in Sponge, `nucleus.kit` is the same as Bukkit's `nucleus.kit.*`. As a result, **by granting `nucleus.kit` you are giving players the ability to bypass cooldowns, redeem kits as many times as they like, and create kits -- including command kits**. These permissions are super dangerous to let anyone have. If you are running a server and you have given the `nucleus.kit` permission to players - whitelist your server and kick all players RIGHT NOW while you fix permissions and check for any kits that you didn't make.

Because this is too common a problem, this update to Nucleus will disable commands in kits by default. You will need to go into the kits section of the config to re-enable them, then reload your config in the normal way. I apologise to those of you that have entered your permissions properly, however I do not want to continue seeing servers put themselves into a dangerous position because they have guessed the permissions they need to use, rather than read the docs, therefore not using the `base` suffix to permissions. 

**Please note that this defaults to false for EVERYBODY, as I want to try to catch servers that are doing this so they are protected while they fix their permissions.**
